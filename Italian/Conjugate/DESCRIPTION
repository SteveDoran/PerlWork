These Perl mini-projects will conjugate Italian verbs through 7 "tenses".

It is not a complete solution to the problem, for any who know Italian, but
it is an interesting problem set.

The only technique not currently used (as of 4/13/2013) id "overloaded

are used, as well as file handles references to provide alternate input and
output paths.
