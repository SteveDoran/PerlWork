This version of the Italian verb conjugation is a 1-file approach.  But it does
have certain complexities that the other versions do not have.

It uses anonymous hashes and arrays to create a list of"endings" used to create
7 of the 14 verb conjugations.  Not a perfect solution to the problem, but
an interesting problem set.

This Perl script also implements several command-line options and presents an
"alternate input/output" capability using file handles.
