This version of the verb conjugation method may be considered by some to be 
over the top.

But we know those people are just silly.

This version does not have the more complex "alternate input/output" of
the first version, but does use three classes.  Two classes implement a "tie"
variable for two "locked arrays".  The third class usersd these two tied classes
and fixed lists of "endings" for Italian verb conjugations.

The last part is a PErl script that has very little code, relying on the three
classes/objects to do the heavy lifting.
